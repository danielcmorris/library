      The library collection consists of over 12,000 works dealing with the Portuguese throughout the world. It holds a vast number
      of books on the Azores and a fairly complete sample of periodicals published by the Portuguese in California, some
      dating to the late 1880's. The library contains many historical materials on Portuguese from all over the world. We
      provide our community with various magazines, periodicals, albums, videos, micro films, etc. Most of the collection
      circulates for periods of two weeks each and books can be requested from anywhere in California through interlibrary
      loan services provided by a network of public and academic libraries throughout California.
